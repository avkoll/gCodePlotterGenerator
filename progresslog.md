- **Tasks Completed**:
  - None
- **Challenges**:
  - None
- **Next Steps**:
  - program micro controller 
  - start on actual table part
- **Notes**:
  - Raspberry pi will control arduino which has a cnc shield and the two tmc2208 motor drivers on it.
  - I don't know how we will tell the table to make each drawing yet 
  
## 2024-06-04
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Prototype complete
  - Lowered overall height by 30mm
  - the motors are set up in the right direction
  - Strengthened y-axis pulley mount
  - mounting screws are now in channels so it can be moved on base
- **Challenges**:
  - Blew power supply, tested with a car battery charger...
- **Next Steps**:
  - program micro controller 
  - start on actual table part
- **Notes**:
  - Completed working prototype yesterday, I am waiting on cnc shield and motor drivers to come in the mail.
  - Going to lower height by 30mm 
  - The robot will be mounted upside down under a board, no need for a large box under the table anymore.
## 2024-06-02
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Prototype made, need to tweak some tolerances and whatnot but the general layout works
- **Challenges**:
  - NA
- **Next Steps**:
  - tweak tolerances
  - design magnet holder
  - redesign control board
  - attach belts and test
- **Notes**:
  - Redesigning robot to replace the 3d printer
  - I did various changes to each part but I have everything except for the belts now I think

## 2024-06-01
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Done
- **Challenges**:
  - Silent printer board was a problem, could not get it to start up without all the printer components.
  - 
- **Next Steps**:
  - develop arduino to control motors with cnc shield and tmc2208 motor drivers. 
- **Notes**:
  - Bars, sand and wheels came in today I will start designing the mk2 of the plotter.
  - 
## 2024-05-30
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Adjusted motor current (reduced by 10%)
  - Tested feed rates (still too noisy)
- **Challenges**:
  - Noise reduction was minimal
  - Need to explore new motor drivers
- **Next Steps**:
  - Research TMC2209 motor drivers
  - See how easy it will be to redesign the rail system
  - Flash Firmware to new board
- **Notes**:
  - I think I am going to need to redesign the entire thing... I can reduce the footprint of the 'bot' if I don't use the 
  printer base. 
  - Micro center sells a board with TMC2209 for the creality Ender, I think this is the way to go. 
    - Creality E3 Free-runs TMC2209 32-bit Open Source Silent Motherboard
      - I need to flash firmware onto it
  - Buying new board and redesigning whole plotter using aluminum square extrusions
