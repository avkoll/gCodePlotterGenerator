# Daily Progress Log

## 2024-05-30
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Adjusted motor current (reduced by 10%)
  - Tested feed rates (still too noisy)
- **Challenges**:
  - Noise reduction was minimal
  - Need to explore new motor drivers
- **Next Steps**:
  - Research TMC2209 motor drivers
  - See how easy it will be to redesign the rail system
  - Flash Firmware to new board
- **Notes**:
  - I think I am going to need to redesign the entire thing... I can reduce the footprint of the 'bot' if I don't use the 
  printer base. 
  - Micro center sells a board with TMC2209 for the creality Ender, I think this is the way to go. 
    - Creality E3 Free-runs TMC2209 32-bit Open Source Silent Motherboard
      - I need to flash firmware onto it
  - Buying new board and redesigning whole plotter using aluminum square extrusions
